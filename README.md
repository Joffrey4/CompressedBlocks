### Block placing and destroying
All compressed blocks can be placed in the world. But, once you destroy them, you don't get back a compressed block. You got a stack of the uncompressed blocks.
**For example:** if you destroy a compressed Cobblestone block, a stack of 4 ~ 7 Cobblestone drop. Like on this picture:

And **since version 1.2**, once you destroy a compressed Stone, it drop a stack of Cobblestone (instead of a stack of stone before).

### Behavior of compressed Sand and Gravel
Like the Sand and the Gravel, the compressed Sand, Red Sand and Gravel, fall when they are placed above the void. And if there's a torch (or any other blocks that can destroy Sand), these compressed blocks are destroyed. And they drop a stack of uncompressed blocks. Like on this picture:
